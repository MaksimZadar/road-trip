# OpenClaw Project Context

## Project: Road Trip Planner
Type: SvelteKit full-stack application
Purpose: Trip planning with route visualization

## OpenClaw Directory Convention
This `.openclaw/` directory is for storing OpenClaw-specific project information.
It's gitignored to keep project context separate from the main codebase.

Future additions should create a new `.openclaw/` folder in each project root
and add it to that project's `.gitignore`.

## Current Development
Branch: social-login
Status: Setting up foundation for authentication features
